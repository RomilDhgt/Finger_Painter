The code utilizes hand tracking to create a drawing application using the laptop's camera. It allows users to draw on a virtual canvas by tracking hand movements and interpreting finger gestures. The drawing color and tools are selected by finger positions, and the application includes features like an eraser. The canvas is overlaid on the camera feed, and real-time frames per second (FPS) is displayed on the screen. Additionally, the code incorporates the ability to switch between drawing tools and colors based on finger gestures.
